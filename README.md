# amimullvad.py
This is a python script that verifies from your terminal if you're in fact connected to mullvad's VPN

All you have to do is connect to mullvad however you have your machine configured to do and run this script to verify that it's working correctly.

This script requires json, requests, os, and termcolor to run. I think most of you should already have most of these already installed. if not just run pip install termcolor. 

I know this will work for most distros without issue, especially since i wrote this on and for my Arch Linux machine.
